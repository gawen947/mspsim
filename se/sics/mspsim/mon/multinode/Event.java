 *
 * All events are created through this class.
 * An event is split into two parts. 
 * 
 * 1) A series of scopes that defines the time/location of the event within a certain context (node/simulation).
 * 2) The event itself.
 * 
 * When you create an event, you first give the event itself to the constructor.
 * Then you add multiple scopes to the event.
 * 
 * After that you pass the event to the trace file instance for writing.
